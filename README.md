# sudofox/hatena-zendesk-helpcenter

An archived copy of Hatena's Zendesk helpcenter articles, just in case they ever change or get removed.

I made this when I worked out that there's some image URLs that point directly to Hatena domains. Neat

## Scripts

`./scripts/update_articles.sh` to pull latest data and download the articles
