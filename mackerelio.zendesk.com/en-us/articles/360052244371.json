    "body": "<ul>\n<li>A specification of the check-log plugin is to check for differences between monitored log files and record the file’s read position (number of bytes) in json format.</li>\n<li>If this json file becomes corrupted, it will not be able to be read at the next check and an Unknown alert reading <code>unexpected end of JSON input</code> will occur.</li>\n<li>File corruption is often caused by the server restarting. We recommend updating the plugin regularly as the latest version has made improvements in this regard.</li>\n<li>To get rid of this alert, the corrupted JSON file that caused the alert must be deleted. JSON files are created in the following path.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J9WRXPXWXHJARC9HH2S3834P\">Linux</h4>\n<pre>/var/tmp/mackerel-agent/check-log/&lt;monitored file path&gt;-&lt;hash string&gt;.json</pre>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J9WRXPXWT3DBFQ0PC8C2ESPR\">Windows</h4>\n<pre>％TEMP％\\check-log\\&lt;monitored file path&gt;-&lt;hash string&gt;.json</pre>\n<ul>\n<li>For example, if <code>/var/log/foo.log</code> is being monitored on a Linux host, the JSON file will be <code>/var/tmp/mackerel-agent/check-log/var/log/foo.log-&lt;hash string&gt;.json</code>.</li>\n<li>For Windows Server hosts, this is recorded under the directory indicated by the system environment variable TEMP.</li>\n<li>Please check and see if the problem can be resolved by deleting the above file or changing the extension.</li>\n</ul>"
