Please <a href=\"https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/howto/host-retirement\">retire</a> the exiting host and start monitoring as a new host.</p>\n<h2>For other virtual hosts / VMs</h2>\n<p>When you recreate an instance and still want it be recognized as the same host as before, first backup the file containing the host ID (saved by default in <code>/var/lib/mackerel-agent/id</code> for Linux OS and in the <code>id</code> file inside the install folder for Windows Server; for more info see the <a href=\"https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/glossary#host\">Glossary</a>) and insert that file in the new instance. After starting the agent, it will now be recognized as the same host by Mackerel.</p>\n<p>However, please be aware that if the agent is running on multiple hosts with the same host ID file, those hosts will be recognized as the same host and monitoring/metrics posting will not be able to function properly.</p>\n"
