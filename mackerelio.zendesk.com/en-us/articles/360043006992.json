    "body": "<p>If mackerel-agent outputs the following log;</p>\n<pre>Failed to post metrics value (will retry): Post https://mackerel.io/api/v0/tsdb: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority</pre>\n<p>It’s possible that the CA certificate of the host on which mackerel-agent is installed is too old. Please consider updating the <code>ca-certificates</code> package or performing a Windows Update. (As the output states, metric posting <code>will retry</code> when communication returns to normal.)</p>\n<p>Also, make sure that your OS is one that is officially supported.</p>\n<p>This can happen if the certificate needs to be renewed in order to establish SSL/TLS communication. This event is not limited to Mackerel and can occur in any case regarding SSL/TLS communication with the host, so we recommend that you update the host’s CA certificate regularly.</p>"
