    "body": "<ul>\n<li>Connectivity monitoring works in a way that detects when data transmission from mackerel-agent is interrupted for a certain period of time and issues an alert.</li>\n<li>Alerts most commonly occur when a host is unresponsive or the agent stopped, but alerts may occur even when the host is operating normally if data cannot be transmitted due to a network error etc.</li>\n<li>In most cases, this situation will result in an error log output that reads \"Failed to post metrics value (will retry)\".</li>\n<li>If a metric can be verified in the host's details screen after an alert is generated, this means that the metric was posted via mackerel-agent's re-transmission function.</li>\n<li>If applicable, please review the following points regarding the status of your environment and that of Mackerel (notifications made via <a href=\"https://x.com/mackerelio\">X</a> and our <a href=\"http://status.mackerel.io/\">status page</a>).\n<ul>\n<li>Are you having network communication issues?\n<ul>\n<li>If so, first try resolving said issues to ensure that communication with Mackerel can be performed normally.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Is the agent running?\n<ul>\n<li>If not, try restarting the agent.</li>\n<li>If the process terminates after restarting, check the agent's log output.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Is Mackerel down?\n<ul>\n<li>Please wait until the problem has been resolved.</li>\n<li>During such an event, data is buffered by the agent for up to 6 hours. Once resolved, this data is retransmitted in sequential order.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n"
